# Cuelinks Quick Start Guide

Get Cuelinks running in Beautynomy in under 5 minutes!

## Step 1: Get Your Cuelinks Credentials (2 mins)

1. Go to **[Cuelinks.com](https://www.cuelinks.com)**
2. Click **"Sign Up"** (free for publishers)
3. Complete registration with your details
4. Verify your email
5. Once logged in, go to **Settings â†’ API Integration**
6. Copy these two values:
   - **API Key** (32-character string)
   - **Publisher ID** (numeric ID)

## Step 2: Add Credentials to Environment (1 min)

Open `Beautynomy/server/.env` and add:

```env
CUELINKS_API_KEY=paste_your_32_character_key_here
CUELINKS_PUBLISHER_ID=paste_your_publisher_id_here
```

**Example:**
```env
CUELINKS_API_KEY=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6
CUELINKS_PUBLISHER_ID=123456
```

## Step 3: Test the Integration (2 mins)

### Start the server:
```bash
cd Beautynomy/server
npm start
```

### Run the test script:
```bash
# In a new terminal
cd Beautynomy/server
node test-cuelinks.js
```

You should see:
```
âœ… Cuelinks is properly configured
âœ… Deeplink generated successfully
âœ… Successfully converted URLs
ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed!
```

## Step 4: Verify It's Working

### Test the API endpoints:

**1. Check Status:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/cuelinks/status
```

**2. Generate a Test Deeplink:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/cuelinks/deeplink \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://www.nykaa.com", "subId": "test"}'
```

**3. Scrape a Product (Auto-Converts URLs):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"productName": "Maybelline lipstick"}'
```

Check the response - URLs should be Cuelinks shortened links!

## That's It! ðŸŽ‰

- âœ… Convert all product URLs to trackable affiliate links
- âœ… Track clicks and conversions
- âœ… Handle commission tracking
