# Affiliate Links Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Links Not Working / API Timeout

### Problem: Render Free Tier Service Sleeping

**What's Happening:**
- Your API on Render free tier sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
- When someone visits your website, the API takes 50+ seconds to wake up
- This causes errors, timeouts, and broken links

**Visual Symptoms:**
- Website shows "Loading..." for a long time
- Products don't appear
- "Network Error" or similar messages
- Affiliate links appear broken

---

## Quick Fix: Wake Up the Service

**Option 1: Manual Wake-Up (Test Now)**

1. Open this URL in your browser and wait 1-2 minutes:
   ```
   https://beautynomy-api.onrender.com/
   ```

2. Once it shows "Beautynomy API" response, your API is awake

3. Now visit your website:
   ```
   https://www.beatynomy.in
   ```

4. Products should load and affiliate links should work!

**Option 2: Auto Keep-Alive Script (Best for Development)**

Run this command on your computer to keep the API awake:

```bash
cd /Users/gaurav/Beautynomy/server
node scripts/keep-alive-pinger.js
```

This will ping your API every 14 minutes to prevent it from sleeping.

**Keep this running in a terminal while you're working on your site!**

## How to Verify Affiliate Links Are Working

{
  "prices": [
    {
      "platform": "Amazon",
      "url": "https://www.amazon.in/...?tag=beautynomy25-21"
    }
  ]
}
```

**âœ… If you see `?tag=beautynomy25-21` in URLs, affiliate tracking is working!**

1. Go to https://www.beatynomy.in
2. Search for "Lakme Kajal"
3. Click "Compare Prices"
4. Click any Amazon price button

## Common Errors & Fixes

### Error: "Failed to fetch"
**Cause**: API is sleeping
**Fix**: Wait 1-2 minutes for API to wake up, then refresh

### Error: "Network request failed"
**Cause**: API timeout
**Fix**: Increase timeout or keep API awake with UptimeRobot

### Error: Links missing `?tag=beautynomy25-21`
**Cause**: Affiliate generator not running
**Fix**: Check `server/utils/affiliate-link-generator.js` - ensure `enabled: true` for Amazon

### Error: Products not loading
**Cause**: API sleeping or database connection lost
**Fix**:
1. Wake up API manually
2. Check MongoDB connection is active
3. Check Render logs for errors

## How to Check Render Status

### Method 1: Dashboard

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Find "beautynomy-api" service
3. Check status:
   - **Green dot** = Running
   - **Gray dot** = Sleeping
   - **Red dot** = Error

### Method 2: API Direct

```bash
curl https://beautynomy-api.onrender.com/
```

**If it responds** = API is awake
**If it times out** = API is sleeping (wait 50+ seconds)
