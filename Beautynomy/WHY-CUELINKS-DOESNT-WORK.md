# Why Cuelinks API Doesn't Work for Product Price Comparison

## Your Question
"Why does scraping is needed if we can fetch all the required data from cuelinks?"

## The Answer

**Cuelinks API CANNOT provide product pricing data for price comparison.** Here's why:

---

## What Cuelinks API Actually Provides

### 1. Offers API (What We Tested)
**Endpoint:** `GET /v2/offers.json`

**What it returns:**
- ✅ Promotional deals (e.g., "Get 40% Off on Select Brands")
- ✅ Coupon codes (e.g., "SAVE20 for 20% discount")
- ✅ Seasonal offers (e.g., "Diwali Sale - Up to ₹5000 Off")
- ❌ NO individual product listings
- ❌ NO product prices
- ❌ NO product SKUs or specifications

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "name": "Grab 40% Off Select Brands: Superdry, Armani Exchange...",
  "merchant": "Lifestyle",
  "discountedPrice": null,
  "originalPrice": null,
  "offerText": "40% off on premium brands",
  "validUntil": "2025-10-31"
}
```

**Use Case:** For creating a "Deals & Offers" page, NOT for price comparison.

---

### 2. Deeplink Conversion API (What We're Using)
**Endpoint:** `POST /deeplink`

**What it does:**
- ✅ Converts normal product URL → Cuelinks affiliate link
- ✅ Adds tracking with SubID
- ✅ Enables commission tracking

**Example:**
```
Input:  https://www.amazon.in/product/B092636SGT
Output: https://linksredirect.com/?pub_id=217482&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.in%2Fproduct%2FB092636SGT&subId=Amazon-lakme-lipstick
```

**Use Case:** Converting scraped product URLs to affiliate links (which we're doing successfully).

---

## What Cuelinks API Does NOT Provide

### ❌ No Product Catalog API

Cuelinks does **NOT** provide:

1. **Product Search API** - Cannot search for "Lakme lipstick" and get product listings with prices
2. **Product Feed API** - No access to merchant product catalogs
3. **Price Comparison API** - No real-time product pricing from merchants
4. **Product Details API** - No SKU, specifications, or inventory data

### Why Not?

**Cuelinks is an affiliate link manager, NOT a product aggregator.**

Their business model:
- Publishers create content with merchant links
- Cuelinks converts links to trackable affiliate links
- Merchants pay commission on sales

They don't scrape or aggregate merchant products because:
- Legal concerns (merchants don't want their catalogs scraped)
- Technical complexity (maintaining product feeds from 400+ merchants)
- Not their core business (they focus on link conversion & tracking)

---

## What We Actually Need

### For Price Comparison, We Need:

1. **Product Name** - "Lakme 9 to 5 Primer Matte Lipstick"
2. **Product Price** - ₹215
3. **Product URL** - https://www.amazon.in/product/...
4. **Product Image** - https://m.media-amazon.com/...
5. **Rating & Reviews** - 4.0 stars, 1,234 reviews
6. **Platform** - "Amazon", "Nykaa", "Flipkart"

### Cuelinks API Provides:

- ❌ No product names (only promotional offer titles)
- ❌ No product prices
- ✅ Deeplink conversion (converts URLs to affiliate links)
- ❌ No product images (offers have generic banner images)
- ❌ No ratings/reviews
- ❌ No reliable platform/merchant mapping

## Evidence from Our Testing

### Test 1: Cuelinks Offers API
**Request:** `GET /v2/offers.json?search_term=lipstick&category=Beauty`

**Result:** 10 offers returned

**Sample Offer:**
```json
{
  "cuelinksId": "12345",
  "name": "Get Your Voltas 1.5 Ton 3 Star AC Now for Only ₹26",
  "merchant": "Unknown",
  "originalPrice": null,
  "discountedPrice": null,
  "offerText": "Limited time AC sale"
}
```

**Analysis:**
- ❌ Not even beauty products (returned AC, protein powder, movie tickets)
- ❌ No prices (`originalPrice: null`, `discountedPrice: null`)
- ❌ No way to get actual product catalog

### Test 2: Cuelinks Search API
**Request:** `GET /api/cuelinks/search?query=nykaa%20lipstick`

**Result:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "query": "nykaa lipstick",
  "count": 0,
  "products": []
}
```

**Analysis:** ❌ No products found because Cuelinks doesn't have product search.

### Test 3: Amazon Scraping (Our Current Solution)
**Request:** `POST /api/scrape` with `{"productName": "lakme lipstick"}`

**Result:** ✅ 5 products with real data

**Sample Product:**
```json
{
  "name": "Lakme Forever Matte Lipstick, Waterproof...",
  "brand": "LAKME",
  "prices": [{
    "platform": "Amazon",
    "amount": 216,
    "url": "https://linksredirect.com/?pub_id=217482&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.in%2F..."
  }],
  "image": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51hcnFvRErL._AC_UL320_.jpg",
  "rating": 3.9
}
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Real product with name, price, image
- ✅ Cuelinks affiliate URL (deeplink conversion working)
- ✅ Everything needed for price comparison

## Alternative Solutions Considered

### Option 1: Merchant-Specific APIs ❌

**Amazon Product Advertising API:**
- Requires approval (not guaranteed)
- Strict rate limits
- Complex authentication

**Nykaa, Flipkart, Purplle:**
- No public APIs for product catalog
- Only partner/enterprise access

### Option 2: Third-Party Product APIs ❌

**Services like PriceAPI, ScraperAPI:**
- Cost: $29-99/month
- Still uses scraping behind the scenes
- Adds dependency on third-party

### Option 3: Web Scraping ✅ (Current Solution)

**Pros:**
- Free (on current infrastructure)
- Direct access to product data
- Can use Cuelinks deeplink conversion
- Complete control

**Cons:**
- Needs maintenance (site changes)
- Some platforms block scrapers
- Requires Puppeteer for JS-heavy sites

## Summary

### Your Question: "Why scraping when we have Cuelinks?"

**Answer:** Because Cuelinks API provides **affiliate link conversion**, NOT **product catalog/pricing data**.

### What Cuelinks IS:
- ✅ Affiliate link conversion service
- ✅ Commission tracking platform
- ✅ Deeplink generator

### What Cuelinks is NOT:
- ❌ Product search engine
- ❌ Price comparison API
- ❌ Product catalog aggregator
- ❌ Merchant inventory system

### The Reality:
To build a price comparison website, you MUST:
1. **Get product data** → Scraping (or merchant APIs)
2. **Convert to affiliate links** → Cuelinks (working perfectly)
3. **Track commissions** → Cuelinks (Publisher ID: 217482)

**We're using Cuelinks for what it's designed for: affiliate link conversion.**
**We're using scraping for what it's needed for: getting product prices.**

## Proof from Cuelinks Documentation

From Cuelinks own description (search results):

> "Cuelinks offers an **Offers API** that automates the discovery of **live offers of the day**, functioning as an **offers feed** that helps keep **deals and coupons pages** updated..."

**Notice:**
- "Offers API" (not "Products API")
- "Live offers" (not "product catalog")
- "Deals and coupons" (not "product prices")

This confirms Cuelinks is designed for promotional content, not product price comparison.

---

## Final Answer

**Scraping is needed because:**

1. Cuelinks API only provides promotional offers (no product prices)
2. Cuelinks doesn't have a product catalog/search API
3. E-commerce platforms don't provide public product APIs
4. Web scraping is the only way to get real product pricing data

**Cuelinks IS being used for:**

1. ✅ Converting scraped product URLs to affiliate links
2. ✅ Tracking commissions with SubID
3. ✅ Monetizing the price comparison platform

**The combination works:** Scraping gets the data, Cuelinks monetizes it.
